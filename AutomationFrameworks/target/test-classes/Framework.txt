1.Page Object model
It is framework where we create class for every web-page 
This classes have repository of web-element and reusable method

Instantiate an instance of the given class, and set a lazy proxy for each of the WebElement andList<WebElement> 
fields that have been declared, assuming that the fieldname is also the HTML element's "id" or "name". 
This means that for the class:  public class Page { private WebElement submit; } there will be an element 
that can be located using the xpath expression "//*[@id='submit']" or"//*[@name='submit']"By default, the 
element or the list is looked up each and every time a method is called uponit. To change this behaviour, 
simply annotate the field with the CacheLookup. To changehow the element is located, use the FindBy annotation.
This method will attempt to instantiate the class given to it, preferably using a constructor which takes a 
WebDriver instance as its only argument or falling back on a no-arg constructor.
An exception will be thrown if the class cannot be instantiated.


3.Data Driven development 
a.Internal data development here we can pass test data from internal class,properties,@DataProvider
b.External data development here we can test data from external sheet like spreadsheet using apache poi api 

Apache poi:
Apache POI, a project run by the Apache Software Foundation, and previously a sub-project of the Jakarta Project, 
provides pure Java libraries for reading and writing files in Microsoft Office formats, such as Word, PowerPoint
